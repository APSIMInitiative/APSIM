## The Effect of Residue Cover on Soil Water Storage during Fallow
### Tracking the Decline of Cover as Residues Decompose.

APSIM simulates the influence of crop residues on the efficiency with which water is captured and retained during fallows. 
Residue cover declines as residues decompose. 
Residue decomposition is simulated in APSIM in response to weather, as well as the chemical composition of the residues. 
By doing this simulation you will reinforce skills learned in previous exercises and learn to do some basic editing of default values to "customise" your simulations.

This module assumes you have completed the previous module: `Module One: Fallow Simulation`. It will introduce you to the Surface Organic Matter module and demonstrate how surface residue decomposes over time.

1.   For this module we will use the simulation we created in Exercise 1 (Module1) as a base. There is also a completed example in the training toolbox if you would prefer to use that. Open the file Module1.apsim.
