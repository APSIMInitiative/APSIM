# Compiling all source code

APSIM can be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or later, MonoDevelop or SharpDevelop. A single solution file exists in the root of the repository (ApsimX.sln). Building this solution will extract all 3rd party packages from NuGet and build everything. All executables will be built to the Bin folder.
