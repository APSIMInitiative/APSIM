The simulations directory contains old apsim daily outputs from running the validation set with dcapst enabled.

Running merge.py will combine all .out files into a combined_simulations.csv file.

If you update the .out files, you must remember to re-run merge.py, otherwise the .csv files will still contain the old data.
